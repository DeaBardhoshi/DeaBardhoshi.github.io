Hello!

======
I have been spending some time recently compiling datasets and reading up on research on my home country of Albania, attempting to understand it from a data-driven lens. In addition to my own anecdotal experiences, I wanted some systematic method of analysing the country’s social, political and lived contexts. One aspect of Albania that recently piqued my curiosity were street names and their patterns. Looking online, I could find no pre-existing dataset that looked at how the roads and streets of the country are named, so I set out to create and analyze one.
For this story, I am going to be using Open Street Map data to analyse gender distributions in street names in Albania’s capital Tirana, as well as dive into the historical patterns and areas of contribution of these figures. To do this, I’ll also use pandas, seaborn and a mapping library called contextily for prettier maps. 

So, let’s get started!
