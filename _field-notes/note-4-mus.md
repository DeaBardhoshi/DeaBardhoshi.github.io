Similar to my previous ['reading questionnaire'](https://deabardhoshi.github.io/posts/2024/07/book-questions/), here’s a set of questions that I’ve come up with to help me understand and communicate about music:

- How have different pieces/songs become more meaningful as time has passed?
- Which ones you used to hate but now love?
- How do you discover new music?
- How do you discover new things in music you already know?
- How do you share music with others?
- How do you develop a higher attention to detail in music you produce or consume?
- How do you listen to music written in difficult personal or historical contexts? E.g. as a response to war, a form of protest, after great personal loss?
- How long do you listen to piece before putting it aside?
- Is there a philosophy or question that the composer is trying to address with their music?
