Here's a set of questions to ask someone about their experience with books & reading (mildly inspired by ['Films to be buried with'](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/films-to-be-buried-with-with-brett-goldstein/id1408585620)):


- What is a book you have re-read (or plan to read multiple times)?
- What is the last book you read in an entirely new field?
- What is a book you read from a non-english speaking author?
- What is the longest book you read?
- Favorite bookstore you’ve been in?
- Book you didn’t like initially but then it grew on you?
- Most beautiful cover?
- Do you read multiple books at once? Or focus on one at a time?
- What's a popular book you didn’t love?
- A book you always recommend to people?
- Last book that changed your mind about something?
- Last book from a person you usually don’t agree with?
- What would you write a book on?
