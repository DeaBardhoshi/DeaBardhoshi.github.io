# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dea, a UC Berkeley Data Science graduate ('23) interested in how data, urban planning and computational social science can come together. I love reading, cycling, playing tennis and exploring obscure coffee shops in cities I visit.

## ðŸ“š Previously ...

After finishing my data science degree (with a concentration in Geospatial Information and Technology), I chose to pursue a career in civic technology, working closely in my two fields of expertise. Most recently, I was a Data Engineering Fellow for NYC Department of City Planning where I worked on building a brand-new data product to map the cityâ€™s historical spending. This work aims at providing a data-driven analytical tool to understand spatial and temporal investment patterns and to inform future investment plans. At Berkeley, I was involved in teaching in data science classes as well as developing Human Context and Ethics Curriculum.

In the past, I've worked on many independent projects, including a data story on hidden patterns in street names, a Spotify music popularity predictor, and using spatial statistical models to predict populations. Over the years, I've also written and coded a collection of data-based articles exploring various questions such as: the best city for foodies, when book authors tend to write their masterpieces, and the state of Open Data initiatives.

## ðŸŒ± Now, I'm ...

Learning more spatial data science! I like to develop my technical knowledge of the various geospatial data tools out there, including data engineering, networks or the use of open data. Often, I post about new tools or exploratory stories in my Medium blog. I'm also working on my monthly newsletter "The Zoned Out Chronicles", an urban planning meets data science newsletter about how data-based tools can improve planning decisions.
