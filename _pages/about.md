## Hello!

### I am a recent Data Science graduate, with an emphasis in geospatial information and technology.  I'm interested in all interdisciplinary applications of data science, but I'm particularly passionate about civic technology and public policy, urban planning, and computational social science. In my free time, I like cycling, coffee, reading and pursuing side projects around my interests. Some of them are listed in this website!

### Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
